The design doesn't include a scratch space as previous.
Instead, it features delayed objects, which are not named yet but can be appended to.
This is used when writing packfiles.
To implement delayed objects, the chunking layer is extended.

GC is not implemented currently.
To add it, we need a graph walker that copies objects recursively,
and a function that switches the filesystem between two partitions.

The object and packfile containers may perform autocommit to flush data to disk
when necessary.  This will not commit any incomplete delayed objects; partial
data may be written, but the root of the object won't be.
Closing a delayed object will write a Merkle tree indexing it.
The tree is built in memory by the chunking layer, but writing it is delayed
to avoid unnecessary churn.
